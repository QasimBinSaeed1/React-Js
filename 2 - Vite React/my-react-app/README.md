## Good React Practices

When developing applications with React, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Here are some recommended practices:

### Component Naming Convention

- Make components with Uppercase first letters: When creating React components, adhere to the convention of starting component names with an uppercase letter. For example, `MyComponent` instead of `myComponent`.
  
### JSX Component Organization

- Always create JSX components: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe UI components. When building a React application, ensure that all components are created using JSX syntax for clarity and consistency.
  
### File Structure

- Organize files based on their type: Maintain a consistent file structure where JSX components are separated from non-component files. For instance, place JSX components in their own directory and keep non-component files, such as index.js, at the root level.

### Example File Structure

src/
│
├── components/
│   ├── MyComponent.jsx
│   ├── AnotherComponent.jsx
│   └── ...
│
├── index.js
└── App.jsx
